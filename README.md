Solace Advocate Search ‚Äî Candidate Submission üöÄ

Hello! This is my candidate sumbission for the Solace Advocate Search application. The goal was to take an early-stage prototype and transform it into a production-ready, high-performance platform capable of handling 100k+ advocates with robust search, filtering, booking, and observability features.

This README serves as both technical documentation and a narrative walkthrough of my approach across multiple phases (mapped to pull requests). At the end of the process, I‚Äôll provide a Loom walkthrough of my thought process and highlight design trade-offs made along the way. If you would like a more in depth idea of the

üåü Highlights

Scalable architecture with cursor-based pagination, full-text indexing, caching, and rate limiting.

High-performance frontend rendering 100k+ records via virtualization with smooth UX features (debounced search, optimistic filtering, shareable states).

Modern design system powered by shadcn/ui, Tailwind, and custom design tokens for a polished, accessible interface.

Advanced search & filtering with autocomplete, analytics-driven suggestions, and dynamic filter categories.

Operational excellence: observability, query logging, monitoring APIs, and SLA-configurable thresholds.

End-user features: advocate comparison, booking workflows, and professional profile data with realistic bios, images, and ratings.

üß© Architecture Overview

Frontend Stack

Next.js (App Router) for routing, error boundaries, and server-side rendering.

React Query for intelligent caching, retries, and server state management.

Zustand for lightweight, persistent client-side state (search, favorites, comparison).

@tanstack/react-virtual for virtualization of large datasets.

shadcn/ui + Tailwind for modern, accessible UI components.

Backend & Infra

Drizzle ORM with Postgres for strongly-typed schema & migrations.

Cursor-based pagination for stable, performant data access.

Full-text search with advanced indexing strategy.

Custom caching layer with TTL-based invalidation.

Rate limiting via middleware for DoS protection.

Monitoring APIs with query logging, slow query detection, and analytics.

Dev Experience

End-to-end TypeScript integration (strict mode).

Error boundaries (error.tsx, global-error.tsx, not-found.tsx, loading.tsx).

Realistic seed data for demos (profile images, bios, certifications, rates).

Built with scalability and observability in mind from day one.
